## People Organization
We have two main groups of people helping this project move forward:

1. **Curators** - These people run the project, put in countless hours organizing, approving, merging and adding content to the project. Their names can be found at the bottom of the https://github.com/pwnwiki/kaliwiki/blob/gh-pages/index.md page.
1. **Contributors** - This group of people add content to the project. _They are the heart and soul_ of this project and we thank them very much for their work! They can be found on the https://github.com/pwnwiki/kaliwiki/graphs/contributors page.

## How to Contribute
1. There are many tutorials on the Interwebz that describe how to work using git. Some of our favorites are below. Please check them out and, if you have never used git before, make a small, meaningful change to a file and submit the pull request. Our team of friendly curators will work with you to ensure you are following the [Style Guide](https://github.com/pwnwiki/pwnwiki.github.io/wiki/Style-Guide) and have everything correct.

1. You can go to the [Issues Page](https://github.com/pwnwiki/pwnwiki.github.io/issues) to find out topics we'd like people to write up and add to the project or add your own!
1. If you are looking for a place to start with a small change, start with filling out one of the sections of the tools located at https://github.com/pwnwiki/kaliwiki/tree/gh-pages/tools page. Links and Example Usage almost always could use more work.
1. If you are still lost, please reach out to @Eid010n, and he will walk you through what you need to do.

## General Notes
1. Please make pull requests of any changes. If you have commit rights to the PwnWiki content, please wait 24 hours before committing your own pull request, but feel free to have another committer review and merge your request sooner.
1. After your pull request, someone will review your changes for quality assurance, and may provide comments on suggested changs prior to the merge.
1. When you do push to master, sync gh-pages using the setup detailed here: http://brettterpstra.com/2012/09/26/github-tip-easily-sync-your-master-to-github-pages/
1. The PwnWiki content is broken down into two main sections:
    1. **Menus** - Each menu mirrors the menu provided with the Kali distribution. The master menu can be found at https://github.com/pwnwiki/kaliwiki/blob/gh-pages/navigation.md, which links to all of the sub-menus.
    1. **Tools** - This is where we are storing all of the tool information files. The directory can be found [here](https://github.com/pwnwiki/kaliwiki/tree/gh-pages/tools) and the tool template can be found [here](https://github.com/pwnwiki/kaliwiki/blob/gh-pages/tools/_template.md)
