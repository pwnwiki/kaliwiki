# Arduino

Notes
-------
The open-source Arduino environment makes it easy to write code and upload it to the i/o board. 
It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The environment is written in Java and based on [Processing](http://www.processing.org/), [avr-gcc](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/), and other open source software.
