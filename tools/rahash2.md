# rahash2

Notes
-------
This program is part of the radare project.

Hasher allows you to calculate, check and show the hash values of each block of a target file. The block size is 32768 bytes by default. It's allowed to hash from stdin using '-' as a target file.
You can hash big files by hashing each block and later determine what part of it has been modified. Useful for filesystem analysis.
This command can be used to calculate hashes of a certain part of a file or a command line passed string.

 -a algo     comma separated list of algorithms (default is 'sha1')
 -b bsize    specify the size of the block (instead of full file)
 -B          show per-block hash
 -s string   hash this string instead of files
 -f from     start hashing at given address
 -t to       stop hashing at given address
 -r          output radare commands
 -v          show version information
Supported algorithms: md4, md5, sha1, sha256, sha384, sha512, crc16,
