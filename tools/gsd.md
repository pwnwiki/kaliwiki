# gsd - Greenbone Security Desktop

Notes
-------
The Greenbone Security Desktop (GSD) integrates vulnerability management into the desktop user interface. Parallel access via web browser is still possible, but not mandatory.

Compared to the web interface GSD offers a faster processing as well as a seamless integration into the desktop environment. Nonetheless all data remain on the Greenbone Security Manager and are only downloaded on request. Therefore concurrent access from different GSD installations provides consistent data status.

GSD runs on various Windows, MacOSX and GNU/Linux operating systems. For installation packages please contact our support team.

Attention: The support for Greenbone Security Desktop is phased out, Greenbone OS from version 3.0 will not be supported anymore.
