SYNOPSIS
       mactime [-b body ] [-g group file ] [-p password file ] [-i (day|hour) index file ] [-dhmVy] [-z TIME_ZONE ] [DATE_RANGE]

DESCRIPTION
       mactime  creates  an  ASCII  time line of file activity based on the body file specified by '-b' or from STDIN.  The time line is written to STDOUT.  The body file must be in the time machine format
       that is created by 'ils -m', 'fls -m', or the mac-robber tool.

ARGUMENTS
       -b body
       Specify the location of a body file.  This file must be generated by a tool such as 'fls -m'
        or 'ils -m'.  
       The 'mac-robber' and 'grave-robber' tools can also be used to generate the file.
       
       -g group file
       Specify the location of the group file.  mactime will display the group name instead
        of the GID if this is given.
       
       -p password file
       Specify the location of the passwd file.  mactime will display the user name instead
        of the UID of this is given.
       
       -i day|hour index file
       Specify the location of an index file to write to.  The first argument specifies the
        granularity, either an hourly summary or daily.  If the ´-d´ flag is given, then the summary 
        will be separated by a ',' to import into a spread sheet.
       -d     Display timeline and index files in comma delimited format.  This is used to 
       		   import the data into a spread sheet for presentations or graphs.

       -h     Display header info about the session including time range, input source,
               and passwd or group files.

       -V     Display version to STDOUT.

       -m     The month is given as a number instead of name.

       -y     The date range is given with the year first.

       -z TIME_ZONE
       The timezone from where the data was collected.  The name of this argument is system
        dependent (examples include EST5EDT, GMT+1).

       DATE_RANGE
       The range of dates to make the time line for.  The standard format is yyyy-mm-dd
        for a starting date and no ending date. For an ending date, use yyyy-mm-dd..yyyy-mm-dd.
