# powerfuzzer

Notes
-------
Powerfuzzer is a highly automated and fully customizable web fuzzer (HTTP protocol based application fuzzer) based on many other Open Source fuzzers available and information gathered from numerous security resources and websites. It was designed to be user friendly, modern, effective and working.

Don't have a clue what a Fuzzer/Fuzz testing is ? Not a problem, read on [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing)

Currently, it is capable of identifying these problems:
- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- Injections (SQL, LDAP, code, commands, and XPATH)
- CRLF
- HTTP 500 statuses (usually indicative of a possible misconfiguration/security flaw incl. buffer overflow)

Designed and coded to be modular and extendable. Adding new checks should simply entail adding new methods.
